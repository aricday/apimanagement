You can create connections of type <strong>MQTT</strong> that are based on the MQTT ISO Standard.
MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol and is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.
MQTT is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.<br/>
