<h3>Startup Listeners</h3>A <em>startup listener</em> is a piece of code that gets executed any time a Live API Creator
server starts up.
<p/>
More technically, it gets executed any time the WAR file for Live API Creator is started
or restarted.
<p/>
You can create a startup listener and have it execute any JavaScript code. Typical
examples might be:
<ul>
<li>retrieving configuration parameters from an outside source, such as a file or a
service such as Consul.
<li>notifying an outside service that this Live API Creator server is starting
<li>starting a background thread to monitor a directory for new files
</ul>
If you define a startup listener, you may consider defining a corresponding shutdown
listener if you need to clean up any resources when Live API Creator shuts down.
<p/>
A listener's code will have access to the following pre-defined variables:
<ul>
<li><code>env</code>: the environment for the listener.
</ul>
