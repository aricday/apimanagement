<h3>Shutdown Listeners</h3>
A shutdown listener is a piece of code that gets executed any time a Live API Creator
server is shut down.
<p/>
More specifically, it gets executed any time the WAR file for Live API Creator is stopped
or restarted.
<p/>
You can create a shutdown listener and have it execute any JavaScript code.
Typical examples might include:
<ul>
<li>writing out some results to a file before the service stops
<li>notifying an outside service that this Live API Creator is coming down
<li>cleaning up anything that was started by a startup listener
</ul>
