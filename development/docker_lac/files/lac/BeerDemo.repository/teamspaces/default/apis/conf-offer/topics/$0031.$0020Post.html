<p>As a Marketing Manager, I want to enable our Partners to send us Conference&nbsp;Offers to participate in their events.</p>

<p>Offers provide Options for Talks (Speaking Opportunities), and Exhibits. &nbsp;These include Costs.</p>

<p>Acceptance Criteria:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Partner can post with this information</li>
	<li>Post request data is&nbsp;audited, for admin tracking and error recovery.</li>
	<li>Conference Offer data is stored in a local database</li>
	<li>A Web App, for users to mark Talks/Exhibits as Used, and approve offers</li>
</ol>
